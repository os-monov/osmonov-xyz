          Skoop was a B2C mobile web app that allowed users to return online
          orders or ship items from home. You could choose a time that was
          convenient for you, upload a shipping label, & add-on any packaging
          you needed. We signed several partnerships with premier property
          management firms & generated a pint-sized amount of revenue. Brian and
          I interviewed for YC W24, but were told that we couldn&apos;t beat
          DoorDash. At first, we were pissed. But, with time & intellectual
          honesty, we couldn&apos;t convince ourselves that we knew something
          fundamentally different that would allow us to win.

          My vision for DocuLink was a product that was half-DocuSign,
          half-DropBox. After interviewing for YC S22 with just an idea, I built
          the MVP by myself. I didn&apos;t know anything about sales, customer
          discovery, or go-to-market. I made the clich√© engineer&apos;s mistake
          of building something & expecting people to come. Despite not getting
          the traction needed to keep going, I was proud of my attempt. It was
          the first large project I built end-to-end because I thought it was a
          worthwhile pursuit; not because someone told me to, but because I
          wanted to.

// it was the first project I built end-to-end just because. Not because someone told me to. but because I wanted to.

// - a SaaS/API solution for securely requesting documents at scale: think DocuSign meets DropBox
// - yc competitors: pigeon & uplink
// - built mvp as sole engineer in ~2 months; code
// - quit my job at AWS to work on this full-time; interviewed for YCS22
